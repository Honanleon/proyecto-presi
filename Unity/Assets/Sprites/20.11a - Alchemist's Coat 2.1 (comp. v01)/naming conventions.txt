You're free to rename the files whatever you want, but this may help you to understand my methodology.
Each bit of information about a sprite sheet is abbreviated, and then separated by an underscore.

Example:
"char_a_p1_1out_pfpn_v01.png" below i will use this example to explain each naming element.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

char
This is a character sheet. All my character sprite sheets will begin with this.

a
Character type A. As of now, this is the only one there is, but I'm trying to future-proof my naming conventions.

p1
Page 1. Each page is 512x512 and has a batch of related animations on it.
If you're using the clothes, hair, etc. like a paper doll, you'll need to make sure they all have the same page number.
There are currently 6 pages:
  p1 (walk, run)
  p1B (alternate page 1 that features the character holding a polearm)
  p1C (alternate page 1 that features the character holding a 2-handed weapon)
  p2 (farming, mining, woodcutting)
  p3 (fishing)
  p4 (miscellaneous)

1out
This 4-digit code references the layer your paper doll part should be set up on.
They should be layered numerically in order to maintain the correct visibility:
  0bot (sub-layer, fully behind the character sprite)
  1out (outfit, lowest layer)
  2clo (cloaks, capes, and mantles)
  3fac (face items, like glasses and masks)
  4har (hair)
  5hat (hats and hoods)
  6tla (primary tool layer, weapons and such)
  7tlb (secondary tool layer, shields and off-hand weapons)
  8top (top layer, special uses, goes on top of everything)
Note: There are occasions where a big hat or hair might cover the tool layer when the character is facing north.
When this happens, you'll want to move the tool layer down for those particular frames.
Also, some hats will require the hair to be removed to prevent clipping outside the sprite.
I can't forsee how big all my future hats/hairs are going to be, so you'll need to check these on a case by case basis.

fpan
This 4-digit code references the exact outfit/hair/hat in the sheet. Some examples:
  boxr (boxers)
  undi (undies)
  pfpn (peasant farmer pants)
  pfbn (peasant farmer bonnet)
  etc...

v01
This is the color palette or variant.
I will try and include a few versions with each asset, but you're welcome (and encouraged) to recolor or tweak any of them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There might be some empty folders in this asset, and that's intentional.
Future assets that add outfits, hairstyles, etc. will use the same folders and naming conventions,
allowing you to easily combine them and keep it all organized.

I will also be adding new animations over time, so be aware that most of the currently empty frames may be used eventually.
